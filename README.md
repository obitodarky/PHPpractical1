Question : 

                                    SET B (Even Number Student IDs)

Make 4 pages of a website which sells commercial products. This is the part of website in which seller enters
his information. It should have the following contents:

- A register page which gets the details of the seller such as seller name, company name, product name,
product description, seller address, state, city, pin code.

- Once the user submits the registered values, he must be navigated to a page which will display all
values he entered.

- A login page having fields Company name, produced items and sold items.

- Based on this information he enters, he must be navigated to the next page which should display the
message as follows (e.g. Company Name: XYZ corporation, Produced Items: 60, Sold items: 40):

“Welcome XYZ corporation, you have produced 60 items and 40 items are sold, now you have 20 items
remaining”. Use user defined function to accomplish this.

- Use concepts of server side validations, templates, Associative array, loops, Symbolic constants, POST
method, relative path and forms.

Note: You need not make the UI design using HTML and CSS, just write PHP code. In forms, you can add
additional fields in the register page according to your discretion.
